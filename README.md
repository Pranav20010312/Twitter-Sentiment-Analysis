# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data using machine learning techniques. The project is inspired by Kaggle datasets and utilizes various machine learning algorithms to analyze the dataset.
## Introduction

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we focus on analyzing sentiment in Twitter data. By applying machine learning algorithms, we can automatically classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on their sentiment.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle.

Methods
In this project, we explore different machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis, such as:

Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
The dataset is preprocessed by performing text cleaning, tokenization, and feature engineering to represent the text data in a suitable format for the selected algorithms. The models are trained on a labeled dataset and evaluated using various evaluation metrics.
